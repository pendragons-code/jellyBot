# Tasks
```
[.] Temp command management
    [.] a way to handle temp ban and temp mute
[.] sharding
	[.] To be honest not a whole lot of point to this but why not ( I doubt this bot would even reach over a hundred )
[.] general back end
	[.] To begin with this project was not really well made and the whole infrastructure really sucks
[.] optimization
	[.] start small i guess
    [.] clean up code here and there
    [.] put error handling at where that matters
```

# Commands
```
[.] basic moderation -> warn, kick, ban, mute, tempban, clear, unwarn, tempmute, unban, serverdetails, slowmode, unmute, reactionroles
[.] slashCommand utilities will probably have to stay behind a bit, this is due to the limitations of time primarily
