# considerations
```
[1] encryption
    [.] encryption will introduce security, this is a no shit thing, but yes.

[2] moving away from quick.db
    [.] quick.db is good, but not the best. However, I don't really think I will be using quick.db in a serious production setting.
    [.] moving to systems like mongodb

[3] integrations to site
    [.] sure, but the new issue here would be security and as a student i don't think i am neither developmentally capable nor financially capable for such a thing.
    [.] possible basic form would be a control panel that is only visible to the localhost

[4] code rewrite
    [.] code does not use the best practices
    [.] code is not actually something people would dare use
    [.] code was written by me, a big no no to begin with

[5] premium integration
    [.] the code is released to the public for people to see, which is ok, but i don't really know if i should or how to monetize of this

[6] maybe i should just abandon this project
    [.] like many others
```
